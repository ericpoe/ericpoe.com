### Background

I am a recovering English Lit major. I graduated with a degree in information technology, not with a liberal arts degree in English literature. However, one of the classes that just killed me as an English major was Shakespeare. We had to read a thousand plays and sonnets and write papers about them -- papers like "compare and contrast Mercutio, Rosencrantz, and boiled broccoli." I bombed the class but walked away with a love of The Tempest, Hamlet, Henry V, and the sonnets. I still have my Complete Works of Shakespeare textbook -- or at least one I traded it in for, and a handful of Arden or Oxford Shakespeare plays.

### To Study Shakespeare or Not To Study Shakespeare

I have been thinking about studying Shakespeare's works again. When I read deeply and paid attention to the essays and notes in annotated editions, I accelerated my learning and appreciation for the nooks and crannies of Shakespeare's oeuvre. It's been a few decades since those muddle-headed days. Perhaps it's time to give the bard another shake.

I found a nice reading-order list from [Benjamin McEvoy on reading the complete works in a year](https://benjaminmcevoy.com/read-complete-works-shakespeare-year-recommended-reading-order/). I like the order, but not the timeline. I'm currently in the midst of two other time-based reading lists -- [Daf Yomi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daf_Yomi) and [Dracula Daily](https://draculadaily.substack.com/), so committing pages per day will further stretch my time commitments. Perhaps the better way for me is to devote at least 15 minutes per day to reading/studying Shakespeare. If I choose to read more or much more on a day, then I grant myself permission to read ahead, so to speak.

The first play I study will be _[Hamlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet)_, from the [1994 Arden Shakespeare collection](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1385107.Hamlet). When I am finished with it, I'd like to watch it as a play or as a movie.

Today is Day 1.
