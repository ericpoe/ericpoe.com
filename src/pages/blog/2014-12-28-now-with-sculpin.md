I have moved my site from one domain to another. I was using Wordpress on my old
site and was happy. Adding pages was a thing of beauty. Configuring was a dream.
Then I wanted to modify my theme. Then I wanted to use some fun HTML5 tags. Then
I wanted to minimize hacking vectors. Then I realized that I was sacrificing
performance to use a database that I was merely using to dynamically create static
content... why?

If only Wordpress were as performant and easy to theme as the first blog I cobbled
together using static PHP files back in the early aughts. Ah, that first blog
was easy to add funky HTML syntax and add features; but each new page required
editing 3 PHP files so the menu, archive, and each individual page would use the
new content. At one point, I figured out that if I used a common naming structure,
that I could tell the menu to dynamically build by looking at the file structure
&mdash; thereby reducing the need to edit the menu.php file. Success!

I muddled through with Wordpress (did I mention the constant need to stay on top
of updates and patches for Wordpress and associated plugins?). Then I discovered
[Sculpin](https://sculpin.io).

The immediate benefits to Sculpin that I could see were:

- Static file generator
- Files are created using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), which means I can add funky HTML tags when necessary.
- The base project is written in open-source PHP, which means that I can bugfix and extend the source as I see fit.
- Theming is done via [twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) & CSS (currently using [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/))
- No performance loss due to dynamically generating a view via database lookups.
- Nice community (a huge bonus!)

In other words, the benefits are that I can utilize it now and benefit, I learn
its components now and I can utilize that knowledge later (CSS, Bootstrap, twig,
HTML5, etc).

As I started to play with Sculpin, I kept thinking back to my original blog and
how close I was back then to what I am now doing. What I was missing then was the
generation of the static HTML files that Sculpin allows.

## Making it work

I spent too much time this weekend trying to figure out how to edit my Sculpin
site locally and yet keep that version-controlled via git as well as keeping my
production code version-controlled via git. Happily, I believe that I have found
a way to do both.

I keep my in-progress code, which includes minor modifications to the [blog
skeleton](https://github.com/sculpin/sculpin-blog-skeleton), in a Bitbucket repo.
I keep my production site, which is generated by Sculpin, in a Github repo, which
is actually what you are reading right now. To keep the two segments segregated,
I am doing the following:

On my dev machine, I have the following directory structure:

<pre>
+-ericpoe\
|
+-+- ericpoe.sculpin\
  |
  +-- ericpoe.github.io\
</pre>

Within my `ericpoe.sculpin` directory, I keep my sculpin blog skeleton and my Markdown source files. I have two remotes: `origin`, which points to my draft on [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/ericpoe/), and `sync`, which points to the source of the [Sculpin blog skeleton](https://github.com/sculpin/sculpin-blog-skeleton).

Within my `ericpoe.github.io` directory, I keep the html files generated by the `sculpin generate --env=prod` command.

Tying it all together, I keep three bash files in my root `ericpoe` directory:

`sync.sh`:

```bash
#! /bin/bash
cd ericpoe.sculpin
git checkout master
git pull sync master
```

`draft.sh`:

```bash
#! /bin/bash
if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "usage: ./draft.sh \"commit message\""
    exit 1;
fi

cd ericpoe.sculpin
git checkout master
git add .
git commit -m "$1"
git push -u origin master
```

`publish.sh`:

```bash
#! /bin/bash

if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "usage: ./publish.sh \"commit message\""
    exit 1;
fi

cd ericpoe.sculpin
sculpin generate --env=prod

cd ../ericpoe.github.io
git checkout master

cp -R ../ericpoe.sculpin/output_prod/* .

git add .
git commit -m "$1"
git push origin --all
```

My workflow now is to:

1. create a new Markdown file with the yaml tuple `draft: true`
2. create my text
3. test my text via `sculpin generate --watch --server`
4. make any changes needed
5. backup the draft by running `draft.sh`
6. if I feel ready, remove the yaml tuple `draft: true`
7. publish to my site, which is hosted by github, by running `publish.sh`
8. every now and then, when the need strikes, update the core code by running `sync.sh`

This simple workflow will allow me to explore other technologies and to concentrate on the topic-at hand while posting about it here.
