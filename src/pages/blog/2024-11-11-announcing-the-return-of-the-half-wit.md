![Image of a bird's-eye view of a wireless Mac keyboard on a rough, weathered wood-plank desk. Superimposed over the image is the word 'Blog' in script. Next to the keyboard is a latte and and a potted barrel cactus that is dangerously too close to the coffee](images/Generic-Blog-Post.png 'Yeah, you see how precariously close that cactus is to the caf√© con leche?')

After a break of ... (checks notes... that can't be right...) ... a long time, I am returning to updating this thing.

Really, it's not my fault. Well, it is. But not really. Being a relative neophyte to journaling, OK, a failed practitioner, but you see, while reaching for my coffee, I grabbed a cactus instead and it took a long time for my right hand to heal. Yes, I like that excuse. It's totally what happened.

### Suffering

So much has suffered since then, including:

- Wallowing in the throes of burnout and ennui
- Pandemic woes
- Did I mention burnout?
- Fears for the future

### Growth

And yet, so much has improved since then, including:

- Promotion at work and becoming a dev manager
- Joining [Merge PHP](https://www.mergephp.com/) as a co-organizer
- Rejoining the speaking circuit
- I read a ton for joy and interest
- One kid in college and another in high school
- Spanish language skills have improved
- First visit to Europe
- Daily study of Talmud via [Daf Yomi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daf_Yomi)
  - Yes, I'm behind. Don't ask.

### Future

I have plans for this site. I want to experiment with a few things, including moving to a new framework since Gatsby seems to be only in maintenance mode.

I would also like to share more about what I'm working on and what I'm studying or discover that I find interesting. Perhaps and old-school blog but without as much <accr title='Personally Identifiable Information'>PII</a> in regards to others.
