I recently had the opportunity to take my love of programming from being a hobby
to being a career. I jumped at the chance.

I am now in my 3rd week of the new job and have yet to go to work. Instead, I
meet up with fellow nerds and geek out on programming. I have survived my first
agile sprint and resolved two introductory issues with the codebase; one in PHP
([Symfony 2](http://symfony.com/) with [Doctrine](http://www.doctrine-project.org/))
and the other in JavaScript ([ExtJS](http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/)).

I have much to learn in my new career and I look forward to every second of it.
