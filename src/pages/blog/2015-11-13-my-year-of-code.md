2015 was my year to really dive into PHP. Up until this year, PHP was hobby language for me -- much as Python, Haskell, C++, Dart, JavaScript, and Java have been hobby languages. Granted, last year I finally took a job where PHP is where I spend half of my time.

This year, I took up intensive study of PHP. At the beginning of the year, I poured over the [Zend PHP 5 Certification Study Guide, Third Edition](http://www.phparch.com/books/zend-php-5-certification-study-guide-3rd-edition/) by Davey Shafik and Ben Ramsey. I even passed the [Zend Certified PHP Engineer exam](http://www.zend.com/en/services/certification/php-5-certification) and earned my [Zend Certification](http://www.zend.com/en/yellow-pages/ZEND027285). I also took up more of a leadership role in my local PHP user group, [KCPHPUG](http://www.meetup.com/kcphpug/), gave a few talks, and have been hosting meetups both at work and at a local café. In the late Spring/early Summer, I began work on a PHP library called [OPHP](https://github.com/ericpoe/ophp). In April, I attended the [Lone Star PHP conference](http://lonestarphp.com/) and got to meet and hang out with quite a few luminaries of the community.

I think I can safely say that 2015 has been a year of PHP for me.

For next year, my language of intensive study will be JavaScript. No matter who I talk with about programming, JavaScript seems to be the _lingua franca_ of web programming. I have already started to look deeply into Sencha's [Ext JS](https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs), which is the JavaScript framework we use at work. [EcmaScript 6](http://es6-features.org/) has piqued my interest since it was ratified in June. I have also been interested in learning more about [node](https://nodejs.org) since it has usage in [Atom Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) and beyond.

By this time next year, I hope to have a native comfort in JavaScript.
