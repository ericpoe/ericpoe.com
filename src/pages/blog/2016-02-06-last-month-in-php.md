From a [KCPUG](http://kcpug.org/) lightning talk given on [03 Feb 2016](http://www.slideshare.net/poeeric/last-month-in-php-january-2016)

January was a relatively light month in PHP. Yet, we saw an exciting new microframework get its first non-beta release.

## PHP Updates

Security and bugfix updates to PHP were released in January. Upgrade if you have
a version less than:

- 7.0.2
- 5.6.17
- 5.5.31

## CMSes

Drupal and WordPress both released point-releases.

- Drupal 8.0.2
  - bug fixes
- WordPress 4.4.1 (**Upgrade!**)
  - 1 Security fix for XSS vulnerability
  - 52 bug fixes

## Î¼Frameworks

### Zend Expressive 1.0

Zend Expressive is a [PSR-7](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) Middleware. It looks pretty interesting and bears further investigation.

**Example:** [sitepoint: How to Build a NASA Photo Gallery with Zend Expressive](http://www.sitepoint.com/build-nasa-photo-gallery-zend-expressive/)

**See:** [Zend Expressive](https://zendframework.github.io/zend-expressive/)

### Lumen 5.2.4

5.2 introduces:

- stateless APIs
- No Sessions
  - This changes authentication

**See:** Lumen 5.2 [release notes](https://lumen.laravel.com/docs/5.2/releases)

### Silex 1.3.5

- Fixed typo

**See:** Silex 1.3.5 [changelog](https://github.com/silexphp/Silex/blob/1.3/doc/changelog.rst)

### Slim 3.1.0

- Adds `getParsedBodyParam()` and `getQueryParam()` to Slim\\Http\\Request
- Adds `App::process()` to allow Slim to run when a Request object and Response object already exist
- [HTTP status code 451](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_451)

**See:** Slim 3.1.0 [release notes](http://www.slimframework.com/2016/01/08/slim-3.1.0.html)

## Frameworks

Various frameworks had point releases. I'm not sure what changed, so I assume that these are bugfixes.

- Laravel 5.2.12
- Symfony [2.8.2, 2.7.9, 2.6.13, 2.3.37]
- Zend Framework 2.5.3
