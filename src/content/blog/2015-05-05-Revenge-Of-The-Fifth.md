Today is the unofficial Star-Wars-fan holiday known as the Revenge of the Fifth.

[Last year](https://twitter.com/eric_poe/status/463399125749223424), I noticed that 5/5 (numerical representation of 5 May, or is that May 5?) can be written in binary as `101 101`. Or more artistically as:

<pre title="the numbers 101 and 101 next to each other look like a pair of TIE fighters flying in formation">|o| |o|</pre>
